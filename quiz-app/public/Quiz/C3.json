    "question": "When a physical risk, like a hurricane, prompts mortgage originators to shift riskier loans to government-sponsored enterprises, this demonstrates:",
    "options": {
      "A": "A successful adaptation to physical risk.",
      "B": "The transmission of risk from local actors to the wider financial market.",
      "C": "The effectiveness of insurance in covering all losses.",
      "D": "A decrease in the overall level of risk in the system."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Page 67 cites research showing that 'catastrophes prompt mortgage originators...to increase the share of mortgages eligible for securitization...thus passing on SLR risk to wider markets.' This is a clear example of risk transmission."

    "question": "What does the text identify as a major challenge for a 'just transition' in developing countries?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A lack of interest from their populations in addressing climate change.",
      "B": "Balancing the right to development and affordable energy with the need to mitigate climate change.",
      "C": "An overabundance of renewable energy resources.",
      "D": "The absence of carbon-intensive industries in their economies."

    "question": "What is the primary message of Figure 3.9, which shows pathways to limiting warming to 1.5°C?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The 1.5°C target is easily achievable with current policies.",
      "B": "The opportunity to limit warming to 1.5°C has already passed.",
      "C": "Limiting warming to 1.5°C is increasingly difficult and requires massive, rapid emissions reductions and likely negative emissions.",
      "D": "Global CO2 emissions have been steadily declining since 2000."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The title of Figure 3.9 on page 62 is 'Limiting warming to 1.5°C is increasingly difficult without large-scale negative emissions.' The chart shows that the pathway (the 'emissions budget') shrinks dramatically the later action is taken, indicating the increasing difficulty."
