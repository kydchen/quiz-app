      "options": {
        "A": "Direct air capture is natural, while CCUS is man-made.",
        "B": "Direct air capture is cheaper than CCUS.",
        "C": "Direct air capture removes CO2 from the free atmosphere, while CCUS captures it from a point source like a power plant's exhaust.",
        "D": "Direct air capture stores CO2 in the ocean, while CCUS stores it underground."
