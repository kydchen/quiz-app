      "options": {
        "A": "Only emissions produced from direct company assets (e.g., factories).",

        "D": "Upstream (supply chain) and downstream (product) emissions, including energy consumed."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The answer key on page 149 provides 'C' for question 6.3. However, the question itself on page 148 is 'What are Scope 3 GHG emissions for a company?'. Option B is 'Upstream...and downstream...emissions, including energy consumed', while C is '...excluding energy consumed'. The GHG protocol includes *all other* indirect emissions. Purchased energy is Scope 2. Therefore, Scope 3 includes upstream/downstream but excludes the specific energy consumption that defines Scope 2. The provided answer key (C for 6.3) corresponds to option 'C' on page 148. This is the correct answer from the book's perspective. It correctly identifies Scope 3 as distinct from Scope 2 (inputted energy)."
